    "CNNs are a more sophisticated neural model for sentence classification than the Neural BOW model we saw in the last section. CNNs operate by sweeping a collection of filters over a text. Each filter produces a sequence of feature values known as a _feature map_. In one of the most basic formulations introduced by [Kim (2014)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181), a single layer of _pooling_ is used to summarize the _feature maps_ as a fixed length vector. The fixed length vector is then feed to the output layer in order to produce classification labels. A popular choice for the pooling operation is to take the maximum feature value from by each _feature map_.\n",

Choose two parameters unique the CNN model, perform at least 10 runs with different combinations of values for these parameters, and then report the dev set results below. ***Hint: Consider wrapping the training code above in a for loop the examines the different values.***  To do this efficiently, you should consider [this paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) from Bergstra and Bengio.  [This blog post](https://blog.floydhub.com/guide-to-hyperparameters-search-for-deep-learning-models/) also has a less formal treatment of the same topic.\n",
